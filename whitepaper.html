<p class="western">Passwords are the keystone of our digital world.
As ubiquitous they are, passwords are, in most cases, the only line
of defence for our digital identities and  assets against the prying
eyes of malicious actors. This paper presents a novel implementation
of password management that allows single users as well as
enterprises to better manage the lifetime of passwords and devise
sophisticated yet simple-to-deploy mechanisms to identify and rectify
broken passwords.</p>

<font face="Roboto Black">Why another password manager?</font></p>
<p class="western">Unfortunately, the outsourcing mindset to password
management has proven to be a recipe for disaster. Here’s a <a href="https://password-managers.bestreviews.net/faq/which-password-managers-have-been-hacked/">list
of password manager that have been hacked since 2014</a>, opening
doors to large blast radius privacy breaches.<br/>
Some common
elements in most of these attacks are</p>
<p class="western">proprietary code-bases used to create siloed
solutions</p>
<p class="western">dated encryption mechanisms and 
</p>
<p class="western">long reaction time to update and patch the
software in face of zero day attacks. Clearly, the ownership of the
digital keys must lie with the parties most affected by their
theft.<br/>
In its document <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/modern-password-security-for-users.pdf">’Modern
password security for users’</a>, Google lists out the following
key guidelines for a password manager:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p class="western">Encrypt the data, at rest or in transit.</p>
	<li><p class="western">Revocable recovery keys that may be stored
	offline.</p>
	<li><p class="western">Multi-factory authentation (no SMSs).</p>
	<li><p class="western">Self-hosted, open source.</p>
	<li><p class="western">Password manager must not attempt to provide
	recovery mechanisms.</p>
	<li><p class="western">Self-locking database access.</p>
	<li><p class="western">Zero-trust built into the design.</p>
</ul>
<p class="western">The &lt;pass_mgr_name&gt; password manager aims at
providing all of the above features in an accessible yet foolproof
manner.</p>

<font face="Roboto Black">Under the hood</font></p>
<p class="western">The &lt;pass_mgr_name&gt; consists of two
components – a chrome extension front end and an encrypted storage
backend service. The backend service can be thought of as an
persisted hashmap. The front-end manages the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p class="western">User profiles</p>
	<li><p class="western">Per-user secrets’ vault.</p>
	<li><p class="western">Miscellaneous administrative operations.</p>
</ul>
<p class="western">&lt;pass_mgr_name&gt; distinguishes between the
administrator and user personas explicitly, even for a single user.
These two user personas govern the allowed storage accesses; an
administrator may create new users and their vaults, whereas a user
may only store secrets under its assigned vault. While the backend
verifies the user identify for each access to the secrets in a vault,
it does not hold any data that may tie a user to its vault; only the
frontend is privy to that info. This design tenet ensures that a
user’s secrets cannot be linked to the user if the storage backend
is breached. 
</p>
<p class="western">The central entity of &lt;pass_mgr_name&gt; is a
secrets’ vault that allows users to stores their passwords or any
other secrets for any website (domain) securely and provide
auto-filling function when visiting these websites, given that the
user has authenticated itself by providing a master password. In
addition to this master password, the front-end also maintains a
secrets’ encryption key on the user’s machine. This secret key,
along with the backend service’s endpoint URL and the vault’s
storage identifier, is encrypted with the master password before
storing it on the user’s host. The vault’s storage identifier is
a SHA-512 hash of a human readable vault name string known to both
the administrator and the users.<br/>
&lt;Verify below
statement&gt;<br/>
Note that while the administrator knows the master
password for the vault, only the user persona knows about the
secrets’ encryption key. This allows the users’ information
within the vault to be secured from administrator persona as well.
<br/>
The front-end uses the backend’s key-value store to store
multiple data elements of the vault, namely:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p class="western">Vault metadata<br/>
In the backend storage,
	each vault-id is expressed as SHA512 hash of a front-end visible
	string used as the key and the list of domain identifiers for which
	the users have stored their passwords or other secrets as further
	key-value pairs within the logical context of this vault. The
	notional domain identifier are computes as SHA-512 hash of vault’s
	storage identifier, plain-text website/domain name and the
	master-password. This metadata is created by the administrator at
	provisioning stage and populated with notional domain-ids by the
	users when adding their own secrets to the vault.</p>
	<li><p class="western">Users in a vault and their attributes.<br/>
The
	user’s name is used as the key. &lt;What is the user attribute?&gt;.
	This key-value pair is generated by the administrator at
	provisioning stage.<br/>
Each user must obtain a session token from
	the backend before accessing the secrets in their vault by
	presenting their user name and attributes. The backend verifies this
	information against the user’s key-value entry in it storage to
	generate a PASETO session token and sends it back to user. The user
	must present this session token for each access to the vault.</p>
	<li><p class="western">Users’ secrets<br/>
The front-end stores
	the user’s secrets for each website/domain after encrypting it
	with both the master password and the user’s secrets’ encryption
	key as a value blob againt the domain identifier of their
	corresponding domain/website, as listed under vault’s metadata.
	These secrets must be recreated whenever their user’s secrets’
	encryption key is rotated.</p>
</ul>
<p class="western">The design ensures that the user’s secrets are
encrypted both in transit and at rest within the backend storage.
These secrets can be made inaccessible either by the administrator,
by changing the master password, or by the user, by changing their
secret’s encryption key. &lt;pass_mgr_name&gt; does not implement
any recovery mechanism for secrets rendered inaccessible.<br/>
<br/>
The
backend implements a deferred deletion scheme for preventing
accidental deletion of users’ secret. A user’s request for
deletion of a secret must be approved by the administrator for the
storage record to be deleted. The administrator may choose to
resuscitate a secret in deferred-deleted state to rollback any
deletions made in error.</p>
